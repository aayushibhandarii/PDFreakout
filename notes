//we don't directly upload to amazon S3 as it is way too complicated
//uploadthing act as a layer on top by which wew simply uplaod file using api
//To use it: 1.go to uploadthing.com > apps>create a new app
//2. go to docs > Next.js App Router Setup 
        //i.npm install uploadthing @uploadthing/react
        //ii. copy apikey key .env.local
        //iii. copy api/uploadthing/core.ts it into a file name at the root

//as inside app directory whenever we want to create public route then we have to create page.tsx file. Similarly, in order to us to expose an api route we have to create a route.ts file

        // i. go to langchain website(www.langchain.com) > get started with javascript>integration>document loader > File loaders > PDFLoader
        //ii.npm i @langchain/community @langchain/core pdf-parse
        //iii. create a new folder actions //any time you wanna expose a function as public http endpoint without having to use an api folder like we did for uploadthing..... you need to create tocreate a new file inside folder actions...and use server directives("use server") on top...this means any function that is exported here in that file are server actions

//go to openai platform login or signup... to get the api key...go to text generation section of the docs
